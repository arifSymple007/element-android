# [[Issue #5114]](https://github.com/vector-im/element-android/issues/5114) Update design and behaviour on widget bottom sheet

## Changes : 
 - update room widget permission bottom sheet behaviour on click outside or on back button clicked (Triggering onCancel event) 
to be the same as the "Decline" button performance.
 - change actions UI from button to colored labels, as was red for the decline, green for the continue action.
